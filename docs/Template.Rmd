# Independent Detections Over Time

With camera data, one useful metric to track over time is the number of "independent" detections captured for each species. In this case, an independent detection is defined as an image or series of images captured for a given species within a specific time interval. In the figure below we present the number of independent detections for each of the 8 main species using a 30 minute time interval; that is, images captured within 30 minutes of each other count toward a single detection and images with a gap of greater than 30 minutes between them count as multiple independent detections. Images that are captured of the same species over less than 30 minutes are assumed to be of the same individual, or group of individuals.

# Temporal Activity Patterns {.tabset}

Given that camera traps operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and can record animal motion down to second-level precision, they represent a powerful tool to explore and contrast the activity patterns of the species they detect. Such analyses can give insight into competition, predation, and coexistence.

In this section we present the temporal (diel) activity patterns for each of the 8 species from MNA Region 1 cameras.

## White-tailed Deer {-}

```{r wtdact, fig.cap="Activity Pattern of White-tailed Deer", fig.align="center", out.width="100%", eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

  filter(species_common_name == "White-tailed Deer") |>
  pull(rad_time)

densityPlot(wtd, col = species_colours["White-tailed Deer"], 
            lty = 1, 
            lwd = 2,
            main = "White-tailed Deer")

# Species Co-Occurences

Camera trap data are being increasingly used to model multiple species communities, and we can use this data to explore the co-occurrence patterns of the species in the community.

The plot below displays pairwise correlations between the species on the left and the species on the top row. Blue colours indicate positive correlation, meaning that the two species are positively associated with one another. Red colours indicate the opposite, that where you have high counts of one species you likely have low counts of the other (and vice versa).

```{r corrplot, fig.cap="Species Co-Occurrences at MNA Region 1 Camera Deployments", fig.align="center", out.width="60%", eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,1))

corrplot(M, method = "color",
         type = "upper",
         order = "hclust",
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45,
         diag = FALSE)

# Evaluating Oil Sands Disturbances {.tabset}

In this section we present the results from MNA Region 1 camera deployments evaluating the impact of specific oil sands stressors on wildlife within MNA Region 1: pipelines and roads. To do this, we estimated the species-specific density at each camera using the Time in Front of Camera (TIFC) approach (Becker et al., 2022). This method has previously been used to estimate densities of unmarked populations of both white-tailed deer and moose in the boreal region of Alberta. Analagous to quadrat sampling, the TIFC approach involves (for each camera) multiplying the number of animals observed by the total time they spend in front of the camera, which is then divided by the product of the area effectively sampled by the camera and the total time the camera was operating. This calculation yields an estimate of animals per unit area (i.e., 'density'). 

The following plots show the average camera density at each of the clusters. There are 3 reference clusters, 2 road clusters, and 1 linear features cluster (pipelines). The tabs can be used to toggle through each individual species results.

# Comparison to Regional OSM Monitoring {.tabset}

In this section we compare the results from the 6 camera clusters deployed by MNA Region 1 to those deployed as part of the broader regional OSM monitoring done by the ABMI. The ABMI deploys clusters of cameras (called 'Joint Environmental Monitoring Sites', or JEMS) in a similar fashion to MNA Region 1, targeting the physical footprint and adjacent areas of oil sands disturbances. These disturbances include linear features, low activity well pads, high activity in situ facilities, oil sands roads, and processing plant/mining operations. Low disturbance (reference) areas are also surveyed. 

There are two common stressors examined by the MNA Region 1 cameras and the regional monitoring done by the ABMI: linear features and roads, as well as reference areas. In the figures below for each species, we plot out the values obtained from ABMI JEM sites alongside the MNA Region 1 values, as well as the overall mean value for each treatment.
